### Project Description
A revolutionary way for students to interact with their educational material. This web-app connects to a student's Canvas LMS data through the Canvas API, and processes it with OpenAI's LLM APIs. This facilitates the creation of educational material, such as flash cards and a chatbot primed with relavant data, that is based on the student's current classes and assignments.
